Executable:     mylocks
Source file:    main.c ; main.h ; sync.c ; sync.h ; atomic_ops.h
Compiling:      "make" command
Known bugs:     none

Purpose:
    To test and demonstrate the performance difference between:
    Pthread Spinlock, Pthread Mutex, my spinlock, and my mutex; 
    Test and set vs. test test and set

Tested on:
    Tests were done on a desktop computer with an i7 2700, 4 physical and 8 logical cores

Usage:
    Compile with "make""
    Execute with e.g. "./mylocks -t 8 -i 50000 -d 0"
    The above command executes with 8 threads, 50000 locks and unlocks each thread,
    and "-d 0" runs every sub-test
